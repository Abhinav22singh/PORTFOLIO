Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase who I am, the skills I've gained, and some of the projects I've worked on. It's a simple yet modern web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with React (Vite) for the frontend and a touch of Node.js and Express.js on the backend (if deployed with contact/email features). Iâ€™ve also used MongoDB in some integrated sections for data handling. This portfolio reflects my journey as a web developer and my passion for clean, responsive, and user-friendly design. Feel free to explore and connect!
